          #About Me
          Designer, photographer, writer, programmer, thinker. Hailing from Chicago; living in New Haven. I'm into cognitive science, social justice, food sustainability, feminism, jazz, France, electronic music, postmodern poetry, science fiction, Chinese contemporary art, mid-century modern, tea, travel, and neons. I think artificial intelligence, emergence, language, choices, and brains are fascinating. The following should give you a glimpse of how I think; if you want to learn more, <a href="mailto:jennifer.friedmann@yale.edu" target="_blank">contact me.</a>
          ##This Website
          Everything on here, unless otherwise noted, is my own work - all photographs, design, and code. I built this using Nanoc, a Ruby static site generator, with Haml templating & Markdown.

          ##Evolution of Beauty
          
          How do arbitrary choices lead to the development of an aesthetic? Richard Prum (Yale Ornithology) has proposed that the evolution of sexually and socially selected communication traits in birds (such as feather patterning and color) should be understood as a form of evolutionary aesthetics, which predicts the evolution of arbitrary standards of beauty among species. 
          
          I'm currently investigating this 'evolution of beauty' using a combination of avian color science and hyperspectral imaging. This involves two parts. First, I'm statistically mapping the dispersal of pigment & structural color in the Cotingidae family, and comparing the rate of dispersal to methods of sexual selection (polygamy vs. monogamy) to determine the significance of "arbitrary" traits. I'm also developing a method of visualizing the full range of ornament on birds, a large part of which we cannot see with our limited visual spectrum. This hyperspectral modeling system will incorporate ultraviolet data (part of the avian color spectrum) into gradient maps of the feather patterns of birds, using tools from Computational Vision & Graphics.
