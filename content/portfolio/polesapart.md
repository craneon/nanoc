content: The assignment - interpret a story in a magazine and create an illustrated book. I took a story on land art from the New Yorker entitled “Poles Apart” and imposed upon my images the same arbitrary geometry that land art imposes upon nature. The full book is 8 x 12 and is bound on a porcupine quill. Created Fall 2011, Intro to Graphic Design.
