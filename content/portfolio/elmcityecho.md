content: I designed the logo and magazine layout, as well as contributing to the overarching vision, for the publication Elm City Echo, YHHAPâ€™s newest initiative during my time as Assistant Director. The Elm City Echo creates economic and expressive opportunities for marginalized members of the New Haven community and gives the homeless a voice. This design aimed to create a low-cost but elegant product that would do justice to its content. Created Spring 2011 for the Yale Hunger and Homelessness Action Project.
