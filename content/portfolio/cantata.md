content: Graphic designer for the New York-based theatrical chamber group Cantata Profana from its inception until late 2014. Designed the logo, many color posters for concerts, black & white programs intended for low printing costs, and developed a consistent style and branding. Worked closely with the artistic director to translate the intent and emotions of each concert's program into graphical representations.
