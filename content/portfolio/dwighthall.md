content: As PR Coordinator on the Executive Committee, I handled all publicity, widespread correspondence, and design for the student-run center of public service and social justice at Yale. My main accomplishment was rebranding Dwight Hall's image on campus by reworking old logos and adding new identities. Rebranding efforts extended to consultation on the new website design, a modernized newsletter, letterpressed table tents (using hand-carved woodblocks), t-shirts, publications, and the lobby interior.
