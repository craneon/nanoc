content: I work with Education & Outreach Coordinator to design and distribute poster, information, and media campaigns for the Yale College Sustainable Service Corps, using the established brand identity for the Yale Office of Sustainability. Recent projects include branding for a city-wide food conference, posters for technoscrap or dish collection, and instructional stickers for every heating unit in the Yale College dormitories.
