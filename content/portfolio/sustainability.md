content: I worked with Education & Outreach Coordinator to design and distribute poster, information, and media campaigns for the Yale College Sustainable Service Corps, using the established brand identity for the Yale Office of Sustainability. Recent projects include branding for a city-wide food conference, posters for residential college butteries and Yale institutional events, and instructional stickers for every heating unit in the Yale College dormitories.
