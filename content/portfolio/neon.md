content: The creation and design qualities of neon and kinetic signs used in commercial art have captivated me from a young age - I grew up in a house filled with these signs, and was constantly warned of their fragility. The only surviving original Lionel train kinetic neon from 1947 (a gigantic, pink steam engine with moving wheels and smoke) resides above my bed; the horse-sized Mobil Oil Pegasus flickers orange next to the fireplace. As I learned more about graphic design, I came to recognize the beauty of the handcrafted glass (all neon signs are still handmade), the intensity of color combinations, the unique letterforms, and the succinct logo-like quality of the signs. Inspired by modern and contemporary light and neon artists like Dan Flavin, Tracy Emin, and Bruce Nauman, I began to learn the craft of neon sculpture at The Crucible (an industrial arts studio in Oakland), and have continued to explore the use of light from neon in photography.
