The culture of materialism encourages settling, in that one becomes laden with objects in one’s endless quest to capture beauty; but it cannot be that to experience beauty, one must also relinquish freedom.

Traveling enables exposure to particulars. It is impossible to love ‘the mountains’ or ‘the Chinese people’ or ‘the French baguettes’ without specific memories of vistas, friendships, or bakeries. Traveling forces one out of humanity’s tendency to categorize into generics through exposure to specifics, which incite an actual engagement with the beautiful thing itself.

Flightiness of beauty (the tendency to suddenly realize one’s error in beauty - either misattributing or over-attributing) prompts a search for truth - but what causes one to suddenly realize an object has outlived its beauty? Is it as spontaneous as the discovery of beauty, or can it occur, like appreciation of a painting after staring and studying, over a period of (over)exposure? Perhaps the realization itself is still sudden, immediate; what comes before is mere strategizing. How pitiful our inability to strategize the maintenance of admiration, but at least it forces us to keep searching for more beauty, to recognize our ability to be wrong and thus understand that there is some notion of right (truth).
