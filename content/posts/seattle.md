There is air, and within it buzzes a freedom, flavored with the rainier-topped cup of cherries and the treble scrapings of distant Elton John. I allow myself to be convinced by a miniature pot of blackberry jam, because it is sweet and tangy and magnificent, because I cannot remember my last blackberry.

The cold bronze against my thighs as I self-consciously mount the pig in my skirt, recreating a memory that might have existed from an age at which one is perhaps better suited to be placed, lovingly, like these pink-clad children whose parents are holding my camera. I grin for them, honestly.

Scattered metropoli, glowing with star-like isolation.

I have been instructed to eat fish. This platter of salmon, pink and olive and red against the bagel and the blue (perpetual blue) tastes as though I never left. I think how quickly one accepts old paths. I am most aware of how content I am to be alone, confident in my absorption of these aesthetics, the breeze, the dappled sunlight teasing the porcelain of my espresso.

My hair whips about on the ferry, blurred lines against my attempts to capture the evasive Mt. Rainier. It is a ghost, bottomless - afloat in swirling crags of snow as though wisps of clouds. Seattle approaches us. Perhaps it is the fast slope towards the water but this flock of skyscrapers hold all the majesty I need.

Chicago: galaxy-level glow, with streetlamp-dappled lines radiating out from the lake against a burning grid. They guide us in before dropping off as though broken edges against a ponderous darkness.
