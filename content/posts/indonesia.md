*Snippets from the notebook, after Lake Toba*

Immediate nostalgia. Sunburnt legs dangling off a wooden ferry, the spray aloft; awareness that I will never return here, this recursive island (in an island).

Exhiliration, at my capacity to be overwhelmed by the view - and pull off the single-lane British-style highway (I adapt) into the dirt to stare at the fluctuating patterns of light on the facing mountains, the space between water and jutting vertical clouds.

Lured by a National Geographic landscape of a single water buffalo and a yellow metal church down a narrow dirt path, we leave the $7 bike. Apparently there is a waterfall, up. We walk too far; we fail to comprehend the pointing old men sitting under palm trees and we lose any trace of the steep path. An unnamed silent man, encountered, leads with machete. The waterpipe is the only proof that we are right. An hour later his dog and he sit on a rock waiting for us to marvel and return.

At first I am uncomfortable with the canoe-roofed buildings, their winding patterns and slated panels and buffalo attached. These are what resorts try to duplicate. But they are everywhere, rising out of bushes far from the main road and defiantly mocking the silent lightning on the rocky horizon. The sublimity, this volcano.
