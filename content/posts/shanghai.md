That awkward time before midnight but after the subway has closed - the only stores still waiting to roll down their padlocked curtains are the massage parlor, the nameless dumpling store, the by-the-hour hotel, Woody’s DVD store.

The canopied street smells of wet sycamores, of their big brown rotting leaves in the fall - a heavy scent like rain, released in exhaustion into the humid night after 14 hours of fighting against the heat. Without my headphones, there are crickets. It is almost nature.

The moon casts out moldy arms into the haze as if trying to exaggerate its luminosity. An eager weed against the most meager of street lamps. The skyscrapers jeer: Magnificence is in our realm now.

I recall a hazy night last year, walking through Saybrook courtyard, when the defraction of light through the clouds formed a perfect circle around the full moon, and I stopped. I stopped and I felt silly for stopping and I kept walking with my eyes fixed upwards stumbling over cobblestones. I got to the Women’s Table and I lay there looking and a stranger walked past and I told him to look up too.

Murky halo, meager moon.

Here is the manicure place, here is yet another tea shop, here is the building decorated like a fluorescent rose with a sign proclaiming “Sincerity” and a fountain of ducks. I feel impulsive; I buy a bushel of jasmine flowers after haggling with someone who was not the flower seller for five minutes. He compliments my Chinese.

Walking through Tianzifang: scattered foreigners drinking beer, an occasional leather goods store selling stupid knockoffs. “HI lady come look outdoor roof terrace here.” These used to be factories. The hanging lights above the narrow lanes feel kitschy, but there is nothing else like it, so I suppose it is unique.

On the main road, I cannot hear the crickets, nor can I tell what these dark stores sell. I try reading characters: small, hour, sale, vacation, big - I get one out of five. I do not know how to understand a culture if I can only understand what I already know.

I imagine growing old and telling my granddaughter of spontaneous walks in a foreign land full of sycamores and lights and dragonfruit as she nods her head politely.
